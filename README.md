# Hybrid-Framework-Selenium-with-Java-
Hybrid Automation Framework Documentation (Selenium WebDriver + Java)
This framework is designed for UI testing automation and combines the Modular Framework (Page Object Model) with the Data-Driven Framework. This approach promotes reusability, scalability, and external management of test data.

1. Project Structure
The project should have a clear and modular folder structure. Key directories include:
- Base classes for setup and teardown operations (e.g., WebDriver configuration).
- Page classes for encapsulating web page interactions (using the Page Object Model).
- Test classes to write the test scripts that utilize the page objects and perform the assertions.
- Utilities for reusable components like data handling, logging, and screenshots.
- Configuration files (e.g., properties files) and test data files (e.g., Excel, CSV).
  
2. Components of the Hybrid Framework
Modular Framework (Page Object Model)
Each web page is represented by a corresponding class that contains all the UI elements (locators) and methods to interact with those elements. This allows the test scripts to focus on testing logic rather than handling UI interactions directly.
Data-Driven Framework
Test data is externalized and managed independently from the test scripts. This can be done through files like Excel, CSV, JSON, or even databases. The framework will dynamically pull the data during test execution, enabling the reuse of test cases for different sets of data.

4. Base Class
The base class handles setup and teardown operations, including:
- WebDriver initialization.
- Browser configuration.
- Common test settings (like timeouts and base URL).
- Tear down to close the browser after test execution.
  
4. Test Classes
Test classes contain the actual test scripts:
- They use the Page Object Model to perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating the application.
- Test data is injected into these test scripts through external sources like Excel.
- Assertions are made to verify the expected outcomes of the tests.
  
5. Utilities
The framework includes various utilities to manage common functionalities:
- Data Utilities: Functions to read and manage test data from external sources (e.g., Excel or CSV files).
- Logger Utilities: To maintain logs and track the progress of tests.
- Screenshot Utilities: To capture screenshots during test failures for debugging purposes.
  
6. TestNG Integration
TestNG is used as the testing framework to:
- Define test cases and test suites.
- Organize and run the tests.
- Generate test reports with the outcomes of each test execution.
  
7. Reporting
Test results are captured and reported in a user-friendly format. You can integrate reporting tools like ExtentReports or Allure:
- Reports provide a detailed overview of test execution, including passed, failed, and skipped tests.
- Additional information such as screenshots and logs can be included for each failure.
  
8. Maven for Dependency Management
Maven is used to manage project dependencies. This includes adding libraries for Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Apache POI (for Excel handling), and reporting tools.
